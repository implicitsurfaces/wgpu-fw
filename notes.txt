things to tier?

- resolution
- number of tracked features
- "oriented" features
- more than two eyes
- client predictor code
  - in img space or world space
- adaptive camera estimation
- texture bit depth
- rm libjpeg + rendering shit from the build for release

things to cleanup:
- use proper SVD for feature rotation fit; cases where H matrix has no inverse are not handled


need to implement:

x load camera image into texture
x mipmap
x filter
- match
  - texture sample stage
  - "align" stage

- expr template for texture bit depth;
  have everything plug in
